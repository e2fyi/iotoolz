            read_to_iterable_ is an abstract method to implement the reading of the source
            resource into the a binary iterator - i.e. you will need to encode your data
            appropriately if it is a string.

            Alternatively, 'fileobj' argument is also provided where you can write to the
            stream file buffer directly. In this case, you should return an empty iterable.
            However, this will be less efficient as the actual read will only start after
            all the data have been read  into the buffer.

            The method should return a tuple of the bytes iterator and StreamInfo object
            which ideally should provide the following info:

            - content_type: (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type)

            - encoding: (see https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/standard-encodings.html)

            - etag: (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag)

            An optional dict "extras" is also provided for any other information.

            Args:
                uri (str): source uri to the resource
                chunk_size (int): size for each chunk
                fileobj: (IO[bytes]): temp fileobj for the stream

            already exists, FileExistsError is raised.

            If parents is true, any missing parents of this path are created as needed; they
            are created with the default permissions without taking mode into account
            (mimicking the POSIX mkdir -p command).

            If parents is false (the default), a missing parent raises FileNotFoundError.

            If exist_ok is false (the default), FileExistsError is raised if the target
            directory already exists.

            If exist_ok is true, FileExistsError exceptions will be ignored (same behavior
